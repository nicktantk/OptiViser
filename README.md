# OptiViser

OptiViser is a visualisation tool for historic options price data. 

I use moomoo for trading, but I couldn't find data for expired options. So I decided to create my own using Polygon.IO's API.

This is a form based application, taking the following parameters from the user - ticker, strike price, start date, expiration date, option type (call / put) - and generating the option's price chart using React's Rechart library. In addition, the underlying's price chart is displayed as add-on information.

The below shows the homepage.
